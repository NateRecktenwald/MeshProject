# MeshProject
Creates a plane mesh and displays a flat earth texture on the mesh. Creates a spherical globe and display an earth texture on the mesh. Then allows for a morph between the two meshes from 2D into 3D and vise versa.\
\
Visualize real-world geographical data on a 3D textured globe.\
Apply textures to 3D objects.\
Algorithmically create a deforming 3D mesh and display it using vertex buffers.\
Define normal vectors and texture coordinates for a sphere.\
Convert from spherical coordinates (latitude and longitude) to 3D Cartesian coordinates.\
